# Bank app

> Example solution for the bank app project, built with vanilla HTML5, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries used).

## Running the app

First make sure you have the [API server](../api/README.md) running.

Any web server can be used to run the app, but since you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed anyway to run the API, you can:

1. Git clone this repo.
2. Open a terminal, then run `npx lite-server solution`. It will start a development web server on port `3000`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to run the app.
