# Event-Driven Programming - Build a Typing Game

## Introduction

Typing is one of the most underrated skills of the developer. The ability to quickly transfer thoughts from your head to your editor allows creativity to flow freely. One of the best ways to learn is to play a game!

> So, let's build a typing game!

You're going to use the JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills you have built up so far to create a typing game. The game will present the player with a random quote (we're using [Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) quotes) and time how long the player takes to type it out accurately. You're going to use the JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills you have built up so far to create a typing game.
