# Explore Collisions

## Instructions

## Rubric

To better understand how collisions work, build a very small game with a few items that collide. Make them move via keypresses or mouse clicks, and make something happen to one of the items when it is hit. It could be something like a meteor hitting the earth, or bumper-cars. Get creative!
