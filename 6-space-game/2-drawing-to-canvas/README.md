# Build a Space Game Part 2: Draw Hero and Monsters to Canvas

## Pre-Lecture Quiz

## The Canvas

The canvas is an HTML element that by default has no content; it's a blank slate. You need to add to it by drawing on it.

âœ… Read [more about the Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) on MDN.

Here's how it's typically declared, as part of the page's body:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```

Above we are setting the `id`, `width` and `height`.

- `id`: set this so you can obtain a reference when you need to interact with it.
- `width`: this is the width of the element.
- `height`: this is the height of the element.

## Drawing simple geometry

The Canvas is using a cartesian coordinate system to draw things. Thus it uses an x-axis and y-axis to express where something is located. The location `0,0` is the top left position and the bottom right is what you said to be the WIDTH and HEIGHT of the canvas.

To draw on the canvas element you will need to go through the following steps:

1. **Get a reference** to the Canvas element.
1. **Get a reference** on the Context element that sits on the canvas element.
1. **Perform a drawing operation** using the context element.

Code for the above steps usually looks like so:

```javascript
// draws a red rectangle
//1. get the canvas reference
canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");

//2. set the context to 2D to draw basic shapes
ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

//3. fill it with the color red
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';

//4. and draw a rectangle with these parameters, setting location and size
ctx.fillRect(0,0, 200, 200) // x,y,width, height
```

âœ… The Canvas API mostly focuses on 2D shapes, but you can also draw 3D elements to a web site; for this, you might use the [WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

You can draw all sorts of things with the Canvas API like:

- **Geometrical shapes**, we've already showed how to draw a rectangle, but there is much more you can draw.
- **Text**, you can draw a text with any font and color you wish.
- **Images**, you can draw an image based off of an image asset like a .jpg or .png for example.

âœ… Try it! You know how to draw a rectangle, can you draw a circle to a page? Take a look at some interesting Canvas drawings on CodePen. Here's a [particularly impressive example](https://codepen.io/dissimulate/pen/KrAwx).

## Load and draw an image asset

You load an image asset by creating an `Image` object and set its `src` property. Then you listen to the `load` event to know when it's ready to be used. The code looks like this:

### Load asset

```javascript
const img = new Image();
img.src = 'path/to/my/image.png';
img.onload = () => {
  // image loaded and ready to be used
}
```

### Load asset pattern

It's recommended to wrap the above in a construct like so, so it's easier to use and you only try to manipulate it when it's fully loaded:

```javascript
async function loadAsset(path) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = path;
    img.onload = () => {
      // image loaded and ready to be used
    }
    resolve(img);
  })
}

// use like so

async function run() {
  const heroImg = await loadAsset('hero.png')
  const monsterImg = await loadAsset('monster.png')
}

```

To draw game assets to a screen, your code would look like this:

```javascript
async function run() {
  const heroImg = await loadAsset('hero.png')
  const monsterImg = await loadAsset('monster.png')

  canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.drawImage(heroImg, canvas.width/2,canvas.height/2);
  ctx.drawImage(monsterImg, 0,0);
}
```

## Now it's time to start building your game

### What to build

You will build a web page with a Canvas element. It should render a black screen `1024*768`. We've provided you with two images:

- Hero ship

   ![Hero ship](solution/assets/player.png)

- 5*5 monster

   ![Monster ship](solution/assets/enemyShip.png)

### Recommended steps to start development

Locate the files that have been created for you in the `your-work` sub folder. It should contain the following:

```bash
-| assets
  -| enemyShip.png
  -| player.png
-| index.html
-| app.js
-| package.json
```

Open the copy of this folder in Visual Studio Code. You need to have a local development environment setup, preferably with Visual Studio Code with NPM and Node installed. If you don't have `npm` set up on your computer, [here's how to do that](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Start your project by navigating to the `your_work` folder:

```bash
cd your-work
npm start
```

The above will start a HTTP Server on address `http://localhost:5000`. Open up a browser and input that address. It's a blank page right now, but that will change

> Note: to see changes on your screen, refresh your browser.

### Add code

Add the needed code to `your-work/app.js` to solve the below

1. **Draw** a canvas with black background
   > tip: add two lines under the appropriate TODO in `/app.js`, setting the `ctx` element to be black and the top/left coordinates to be at 0,0 and the height and width to equal that of the canvas.
2. **Load** textures
   > tip: add the player and enemy images using `await loadTexture` and passing in the image path. You won't see them on the screen yet!
3. **Draw** hero in the center of the screen in the bottom half
   > tip: use the `drawImage` API to draw heroImg to the screen, setting  `canvas.width / 2 - 45` and `canvas.height - canvas.height / 4)`;
4. **Draw** 5*5 monsters
   > tip: Now you can uncomment the code to draw enemies on the screen. Next, go to the `createEnemies` function and build it out.

   First, set up some constants:

    ```javascript
    const MONSTER_TOTAL = 5;
    const MONSTER_WIDTH = MONSTER_TOTAL * 98;
    const START_X = (canvas.width - MONSTER_WIDTH) / 2;
    const STOP_X = START_X + MONSTER_WIDTH;
    ```

    then, create a loop to draw the array of monsters onto the screen:

    ```javascript
    for (let x = START_X; x < STOP_X; x += 98) {
        for (let y = 0; y < 50 * 5; y += 50) {
          ctx.drawImage(enemyImg, x, y);
        }
      }
    ```

## Result

The finished result should look like so:

![Black screen with a hero and 5*5 monsters](partI-solution.png)

## Solution

Please try solving it yourself first but if you get stuck, have a look at a [solution](solution/app.js)

## ðŸš€ Challenge

You've learned about drawing with the 2D-focused Canvas API; take a look at the [WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API), and try to draw a 3D object.
