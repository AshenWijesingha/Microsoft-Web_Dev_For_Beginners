# Build a Sample Game

## Instructions

Try building a small game where you practice on different end conditions. Vary between getting a number of points, the hero loses all lives or all monsters are defeated. Build something simple like a console based adventure game. Use the below game flow as inspiration:

```
Hero> Strikes with broadsword - orc takes 3p damage
Orc> Hits with club - hero takes 2p damage
Hero> Kicks - orc takes 1p damage
Game> Orc is defeated - Hero collects 2 coins
Game> ****No more monsters, you have conquered the evil fortress****
```
