# Build a Space Game

A space game to teach more advanced JavaScript fundamentals

In this lesson you will learn how to build your own space game. If you've ever played the game "Space Invaders", this game has the same idea: to steer a spaceship and fire on monsters that come down from above. Here's what the finished game will look like:
