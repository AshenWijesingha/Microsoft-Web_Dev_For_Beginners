# Contribute by translating lessons

We welcome translations for the lessons in this curriculum!

## Guidelines

There are [**translations**](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started-lessons/1-intro-to-programming-languages/translations) folders which contain the translated markdown files.

Translated lessons should follow this naming convention:

**README._[language]_.md**

where _[language]_ is a two letter language abbreviation following the ISO 639-1 standard (e.g. `README.es.md` for Spanish and `README.nl.md` for Dutch).
